# hello-world

Hello world,

I am a young coder trying to make a career change! Just starting to feel like I know a little bit what i'm doing with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Excited to keep learning more and figuring out what I exactly want to do with my coding! Going to learn Python next and some more computer science languages.

Goodbye for now!
